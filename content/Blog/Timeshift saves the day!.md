I had a moment of frustration when I turned my workstation on today and discovered the updates I did before I shut it down last night had messed with my Nvidia drivers some how and caused my system to boot without video drivers so my multi-monitor setup was broken.

After a few minutes of thought I remembered when I setup the system I setup [[Timeshift]] as well with daily automatic snapshots!  After opening [[Timeshift]] and selecting restore using the previous days snapshot I rebooted the system and was presented with a fully functioning system with active Nvidia drivers.

I'm sure it saved hours of frustration trying to fix the broken Nvidia drivers!
